You are migrating the "homepage" service to the homelab port/DNS control-plane pattern.

Known working pattern (from prior migrations):
- `homelab-infra/registry.yaml` is authoritative for DNS names, host placement, and host-exposed ports.
- `homelab-edge` renders/applies dnsmasq + nginx from that registry.
- Each application service runs in its own repository (compose + app code), binds to the host port allocated in registry.yaml, and is reached via nginx + TLS.

Goal:
Migrate "homepage" so it is a normal service:
- host-exposed port MUST match `services.homepage.upstream.port` in `../homelab-infra/registry.yaml` (expected to be 20017)
- service DNS is `home.stanley.arpa`
- nginx proxies to `http://<adler_ip>:<registry_port>` and clients use `https://home.stanley.arpa`

Constraints:
- Keep changes minimal and follow existing conventions in THIS repository.
- Do NOT create new tooling conventions (no new frameworks; don’t add Poetry if not used, etc).
- Do NOT duplicate `registry.yaml` in this repo.
- Do NOT use git submodules.
- Prefer to mount or reference `../homelab-infra/registry.yaml` for any derived config.
- Avoid binding the service port to 127.0.0.1 only; it must be reachable on the host LAN IP because nginx upstream uses host IPs.

Authoritative registry schema (relevant):
services.homepage:
  dns: home.stanley.arpa
  proxy_host: adler
  upstream:
    host: adler
    port: 20017
    scheme: http

Tasks:

1) Ensure registry entry exists and matches expectation
- If you can access ../homelab-infra/registry.yaml at runtime, verify that `services.homepage` exists with:
  - dns: home.stanley.arpa
  - upstream.port: 20017
  - upstream.host: adler
  - scheme: http
- If not present, print clear instructions for the user to add it (do not guess).

2) Update this repo's runtime to bind the correct host port
- If homepage runs under Docker Compose:
  - Update docker-compose.yml so that the HOST port equals `services.homepage.upstream.port` from the registry (20017).
  - Keep the container internal port unchanged.
  - Ensure the port mapping is NOT restricted to 127.0.0.1 (do not use 127.0.0.1:HOST:CONTAINER).
- If homepage is not Docker Compose:
  - Update its listen port to 20017 and ensure it binds on 0.0.0.0 or the LAN IP, not loopback-only.

3) Optional but preferred: derive host port from registry automatically
- If it can be done with minimal change and existing tooling:
  - Add a small script (under scripts/) that reads `services.homepage.upstream.port` from `../homelab-infra/registry.yaml`
  - Exports it as an env var used by docker compose (e.g. HOMEPAGE_HOST_PORT)
- If this repo already uses a similar pattern (like env-from-registry), reuse it.
- If adding this would cause big changes, it is acceptable to hardcode 20017 in compose for now, but document that it is allocated by homelab-infra.

4) Update README.md for the homepage repo
- State that the host port is allocated in `homelab-infra/registry.yaml` and must not drift.
- Provide run instructions, preferably a single canonical command.
- Do NOT mention editing DNS/nginx here (those are handled by homelab-edge).

5) Verification steps (documented)
- Add a short section (README or scripts/verify.sh) showing:
  - curl to upstream locally: `curl -I http://10.92.8.6:20017/` (or localhost if you prefer but ensure correct bind)
  - curl to public service via nginx: `curl -kI https://home.stanley.arpa/`

Acceptance criteria:
- `docker ps` shows homepage running.
- `ss -lntp` on adler shows LISTEN on :20017 (not only 127.0.0.1).
- `curl -I http://10.92.8.6:20017/` returns a response (any 2xx/3xx is fine).
- `curl -kI https://home.stanley.arpa/healthz` returns 200 (nginx).
- `curl -kI https://home.stanley.arpa/` does not return 502.

Important:
This migration is only about aligning the service bind port and docs. Do not redesign the service.
Keep changes minimal.
